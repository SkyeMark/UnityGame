# UnityGame
This repository houses many scripts I've written in my own time as I learn to use the Unity3D Game engine. Feel free to make use of them yourself! 

Note: The code in this repository is object oriented C# and is used in Unity version 5.X+, which is important to note due to changes in syntax between Unity 4.X and 5.X
